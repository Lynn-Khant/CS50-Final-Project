Assignment Tracker System is a web application that can help you keep track of your assignments,deadline,progress etc.It includes login page,register page,schedule creating page,index landing page,schedule updating page and also a middleware that prevents users from  getting access to the pages without logging in.
To use the application,you have to register first.Registeration form includes name,email,password,confirm password inputs.It is compulsory to fill in all of them.Errors messages are also included to indicate which input field the user filled in amiss.
In the register function in app.py,the input field credentials are checked.If there is an error,error message with a corresponding input field name is added to the errors dict created.Also the input values user filled in are listed in the values dict so that if there is an error both the error messages and input values can be returned to the register template where the error messages are systematically displayed using red font color.Also ValueError exception is used in the register function when checking the register email credential.
After registering for an account successfully,it will redirect the user to the login page where two input fields,email and pasword,must be filled.This page also includes error messages.Passwords are hashed before storing in the databse,so check_password_hash() function is used to check if the credentials are met.
In the login function in app.py,the input field credentials are checked again.If there is an error,error messages along side with input field names are added to the errors dict.Also the input values user filled in are listed in the values dict except for the password field.If the login process is succeeded,user info is stored in session.
After Succesfully logging in,the user will be directed to the home page where the schedule of the user is displayed using the table.Schedule creating button,schedule updating button,and also logout buttons are displayed on this page.Otherwise only the information relating to the current week will be displayed if there is any.
In the index function in app.py,request.args.get("weeks") is checked.What it basically does is that if the user chose the specific week they would like to view,information relating just to that week and the user logged in will be retreated from the database and displayed.
Everytime homepage is refreshed or reentered,daysleft row will be updated using the deadline and current date data from the database.Whenever the user view the specific week by choosing the week and hitting the search button,url will be updated with the date user chose.
On the schedule creating page,--assignment name,deadline,subject--three inputs are included.As soon as you upload your assignment information,form function in app.py will check the credentials first and then store the user uploaded data and relating information being daysLeft,progress,status and foreign ids in the assignments table in the database.If there is an error,it will redirect back to the create page with error messages and old user inputs alongside their corresponding input field names.
In the create function in app.py,if there is no error,user inputs alongside with other relating data are prepared to be stored in the database.DaysLeft is calculated using the deadline date and the current date.datetime.strptime() method is used to calculate the daysLeft.For the weekId,it is checked if the current day is monday and that the current week has not already been stored in the weeks database.If those are met, new week is stored in the weeks database whose id is stored in the assignments table for the row that is being handled.If it is not new week meaning if it is not monday today,last inserted id of the weeks table is retrieved instead and used.
On the schedule updating page,four input fields--assignment name,deadline,subject,progress-- and one select field will pop up with the old data which is retrieved from the database and already filled in for the user to edit.When being uploaded,If there is an error,it will redirect back to the update page with error messages and new user inputs alongside their corresponding input field names.When the user click the update button for one assignment,corresponding assignment id will be send with the url query back to the function.
There is a red logout button for the user to log out.
UI for the app is very simple.all the user input forms are centered with blue color background.A table is used to display all the assignments.
